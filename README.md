# Bird Strike Analysis Database

This GitHub repository documents a comprehensive project to build and analyze a database for bird strike incidents on aircraft. Utilizing a data set from the FAA, the project encompasses creating a logical data model and a relational schema in MySQL/MariaDB, loading data from CSV files, executing SQL queries, and performing basic data analysis.

## Key aspects of the project include:

* **Database Creation and Connection:** Setting up a MySQL/MariaDB database and connecting to it from R for data manipulation and querying.
* **Schema Design and Data Loading:** Building a relational schema in 3NF/BCNF, harmonizing data, and loading it from CSV files.
* **SQL Query Execution and Analysis:** Executing various SQL queries for insights such as the top airlines with the most incidents and identifying flight phases with above-average bird strike incidents.
* **Visualization and Stored Procedures:** Creating visualizations for bird strike incidents per year and developing stored procedures for adding new incidents.

This project serves as an applied example of using R, SQL, and MySQL/MariaDB for practical database management and analytics.
